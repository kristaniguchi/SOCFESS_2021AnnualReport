# SOCFESS_2021AnnualReport
Scripts used to develop data products associated with Flow Ecology Level 1 and Level 2 Assessments.  The primary purpose of the flow ecology analysis is to prioritize areas where actions to restore more natural flow conditions will benefit the ecology and support beneficial uses and to identify the flow conditions necessary to support those uses. The intent is NOT to establish flow criteria, but to inform restoration and management planning.
